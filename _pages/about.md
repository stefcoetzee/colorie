## About

Hi, I’m Stef. I see technological development as the central focus of my 
professional life.

I currently work as a consulting engineer in the control and 
automation field. 
Previously, I obtained a master’s degree in electrical engineering, with focus 
on residential renewable energy optimization, at Stellenbosch University, 
South Africa. 
Prior to that, I completed a bachelor’s degree in electrical and electronic 
engineering, also at SU.

This site is meant to facilitate sharing of information. 
If you, like me, enjoy discovering books by seeing what others have read, take 
a look at my bookshelf. 
If you’d like to read something I wrote, head over to the writing page. 
Naturally, all views are my own.
